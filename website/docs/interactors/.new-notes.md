### dear jen
- `1-quick-start`
  - rearranged the sample app introduction, could you have a read? (Done, made some edits)
  - goal/sample section at the bottom needs a re-write
    <!-- - asked charles/jonas for examples on what we should showcase
      - becaues i haven't written many tests, i don't know what complicated ui interaction would make this most appealing
      - maybe you'd have some ideas too? (I like what you have with the airline example!) -->
    - added airline date picker example (reviewed, edited)
- `4-write-your-own`
  - check html markup; i tried to make it as minimal as possible (looks good!)
  - at the bottom of the jeopardy section i think we need to wrap up the section with a sentence or two (done)
  - lines 49-77 added more informatino on actions (reviewed)
  - ‚ùó there's a new "warning" at the top of the page because we'll be introducing a new syntax soon. "Why not just release the documentation with those new changes?" jonas is out until january and i think charles wants a presentable preview doc asap for folio organization. i just wrote out a rough draft. (Looks good to me!)

### todos
- sandbox
- double check consistency of syntax/stylings/indents

# done recently
- `3-locators-filters-actions`:
  - mention how the locator/filters will return a list but if there are more than one returned elements, errror
- update all the empty links with api links
- replace hypothetical placeholder interactors ('MyInteractor()') with a built-in
- "looks like there is some flash/jank on the navigation where they rezie momentarily" cc'd jorge in the issue
- assertions should generally use `is()/has()` so go over and replace all the assertion examples of `.exists()`.
  - maybe use exists for the first few times and then add a side note about how is/has is suggested because it's more explicit
  - this suggestion was made from the built-in page but take a look at all the examples and make your judgment
  - # updated all the assertions and used one that i thought was most appropriate
- `2-built-in-dom`
  - updated the assertions in the page section and added some explanations to the new assertion methods and the explanation on how page does not need to be called like the other built-in interactors
    - i think the instantiating explanation might not be accurate in technical terms but i think it's worth explaining or otherwise people will try `Button.has({ id: 'beep' })` and get an error
- `3-locators-filters-actions`
  - deleted the part about the mutable API limitation; it was originally something they brought up but i think mentioning it preemptively would just require us to explain the problem that should not exist in the first place
    - so we'll do the lazy thing and let people approach us if they discover it and we'll fix it then i guess?
  - changed `string argument is used by the locator` to `would be the locator`
  - Starting from the filters section, i've swapped out the button example for textfield
    - jonas suggests that we say `is()` is for adjectives and `has()` is for nouns but i think it's more of an implied rule and we do point it out by saying the difference is in semantics so i don't think we need to actually say it out loud.

# old notes
## 1-quick-start
  - added suggestion for introducing and linking bigtest platform
  - added reminder on changing todomvc link to bigtest sample
  - moved the bigtest platform intro from the bottom of the page to after the tabbed section where people see it for the first time. i think we'll get more views there. i tend to skip the last few paragraphs when it looks like it's wrapping up.

## 2-built-in-dom
  - added section on page interactor

## 3-locators-filters-actions
  - suggestion for locator section
    - changed "most common" to "simplest"
  - rearranged filters
    - added the part where multiple filters can be specified
    - removed the list of all the button filters because it might cause confusion of whether it's something that's offered on all default interactors.
    - added has() and is() as a subsection in filters
  - added find() section on how you can use them in tests too
    - used the datepicker example from how you use find() in createinteractor()

## 4-write-your-own
  - changed example to button and updated instructions
  - removed note on expanding the simple example because it's no longer a checkbox and we still have the complex example
  - got the ball rolling for the complex example `4-write-your-own`
    - example and explanation could be better
    - i'm not sure how much we should dive into the small details

## 5-integration
  - replaced sof/forum links with cypress docs
