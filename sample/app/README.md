# BigTest Sample App

This app shows some examples of using BigTest and Interactors to programatically test a web app.

[BigTest](https://frontside.com/bigtest/platform) is a free, Open Source testing platform built from scratch for the modern age â€” with no traces of Selenium, Playwright, or earlier tools.

You can learn more about these tools and create your own sample app by following [the Quick Start](https://frontside.com/bigtest/docs/interactors).
