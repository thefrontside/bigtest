# BigTest Sample App

This app shows some examples of using BigTest and Interactors to programatically test a web app.

[BigTest](https://frontside.com/bigtest/platform) is a free, Open Source testing platform built from scratch for the modern age â€” with no traces of Selenium, Playwright, or earlier tools.

You can learn more about these tools and create your own sample app by following [the Quick Start](https://frontside.com/bigtest/docs/interactors).

## Run Tests

This sample app has multiple testing libraries installed so that you can see how Interactors fit into your existing test suite.

To run each test suite individually:

```
$ npm run test:bigtest
$ npm run test:jest
$ npm run test:cypress
```
