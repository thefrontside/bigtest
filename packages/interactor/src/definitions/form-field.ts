/**
 * Use this {@link InteractorConstructor} as a base for creating interactors which
 * work with form fields. This allows you to use field labels as locators, and also provides
 * some basic filters which are convenient for most form fields.
 *
 * Locates the form field by its label.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ``` typescript
 * const PasswordField = FormField.extend<HTMLInputElement>('password field')
 *   .selector('input[type=password'])
 *   .filters({
 *     value: (element) => element.value,
 *     placeholder: (element) => element.placeholder,
 *   })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Filters
 *
 * - `title`: *string* – Filter by title
 * - `id`: *string* – Filter by id
 * - `visible`: *boolean* – Filter by visibility. Defaults to `true`. See {@link isVisible}.
 * - `focused`: *boolean* – Filter by whether the form field is focused. See {@link focused}.
 * - `valid`: *boolean* – Filter by whether the form field is valid.
 * - `disabled`: *boolean* – Filter by whether the form field is disabled. Defaults to `false`.
 *
 * ### Actions
 *
 * - `click()`: *{@link Interaction}* – Click on the form field
 * - `focus()`: *{@link Interaction}* – Move focus to the form field
 * - `blur()`: *{@link Interaction}* – Move focus away from the form field
