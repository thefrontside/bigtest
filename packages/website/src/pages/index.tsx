            BigTest is a framework that enables you to test real-world experiences on your app rapidly, in every
            browser and device, regardless of which framework you use.

            When building an application for the web, it's not enough to know if the code works at the component
            level. Instead, it's vital to test from the perspective of a real person who will be using it. Does
            your app work in a real browser? What about multiple browsers and devices? Where are the wrinkles that
            need to be ironed out?

            BigTest validates your code from the perspective of your user--what they see and interact with. This
            makes it possible to not only test individual functionality, but also get visibility on how different
            components interact and how a release will affect other parts of the code base.

          <Text>
            When you're trying to test from the perspective of your user, there's a lot of information coming in.
            All the clicks, streaming updates from the server, and the hundreds (or thousands) of background
            processes create a highly asynchronous environment. As a result, UI testing has historically been
            time-intensive in both setup and run time.

            BigTest brings a new stateful architecture, along with several paradigm shifts that allow tests to be faster to write, execute, and maintain.

          <Text>
            Traditional testing has a tendency to become unwieldy. And when it comes to SPAs, most testing tools
            aren't designed to easily test asynchrony and DOM based interactions. As a result, your team spends
            more time dealing with asynchrony and figuring out DOM selectors than actually writing tests.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            BigTest solves this with what we call <i>Interactors</i>, which act as a composable abstractions that
            are easy to reuse, even in large component-based applications. This allows your team to focus on
            writing tests, rather than looking for DOM selectors or making updates every time a selector changes.
