/**
 * Capture a promise that will only resolve once a given condition
 * has been met. The condition will be tested once every 10ms and is
 * considered to be met when it does not error or return false. If the
 * assertion never passes, then the promise will reject right before
 * the timeout period with the last error it recieved while running
 * the assertion.
 *
 * If `always` is true, then the promise will resolve only if the
 * condition has been met consistently over the entire timeout
 * period. And it will reject the first time it encounters an
 * error.
 *
 * When `useStats` is true, the returned promise will resolve with a
 * stats object. This stats object holds various information about how
 * this convergent assertion ran.
 *
 * @param {Function} assertion - run to test condition repeatedly
 * @param {Number} [timeout=2000] - milliseconds to check assertion
 * @param {Boolean} [always] - if true, the assertion must pass
 * throughout the entire timeout period
 * @param {Boolean} [useStats] - if true, resolves with a stats object
 * @returns {Promise} resolves if the assertion passes at least once;
 * if `always` is true, then rejects at the first error instead
