/**
 * The convergence class. Creating a new Convergence instance allows
 * you to chain convergent assertions together and execute them all at
 * once within a single timeout period.
 *
 * When you initialize a Convergence instance, you can provide a
 * timeout that will determine the total allowed time for all
 * convergences in this instance's stack.
 *
 * A Convergence instance is similar to a Promise or Observable, in
 * that it's methods return new Convergence instances. This allows you
 * to split a convergence and start each of them separately using
 * their respecting `.run()` methods.
 *
 * The `.timeout()` method only returns a new Convergence when you
 * provide a new timeout. If you do not provide any arguments, it will
 * instead return the current set timeout of the convergence.
 *
 * The `.run()` method _does not_ return a new Convergence
 * instance. It returns a promise that resolves or rejects depending
 * on the success of the assertions used to construct it. The `.run()`
 * method actually starts the assertions, and since it returns a new
 * promise each time, you can call `.run()` multiple times on the same
 * convergence instance.
 *
 * See the documentation below for each individual method.
 *
 * Example:
 *   let first = new Convergence(100)
 *     .once(() => expect(foo).to.equal('bar'))
 *
 *   let second = first.timeout(200)
 *     .do(() => console.log('foo', foo))
 *     .always(() => expect(foo).to.equal('bar'))
 *
 * `first.run()` has 100ms to converge on it's assertion.
 *
 * `second.run()` will log `foo` once the first assertion converges
 * and continue to assert the second assertion until just before the
 * 200ms timeout period has expired.
