It's a big question, and it can't be answered with small tests that
observe a tiny portion of your code that isn't integrated with any
thing else. Big questions need big tests.

What does a big test look like?

### Real Applications

The surest way to know if an application is going to work is to
actually run it. Big tests boot the entire application before every
testcase.

### Real Browsers

Does your appication run in a browser? Then if a test is going to
measure whether it works or not, it also needs to run in a _real_
browser that a _real_ user might use, and it should dispatch _real_ UI
events against a _real_ DOM.

### Real Asynchrony

Testing big is hard because there can be hundreds if not thousands of
things happening concurrently inside your application; including user
interactions.

### Real API Requests

Does your app make requests to an API? Then your tests should hammer
the network too. Otherwise, you're measuring air.
